# HackersBot Beta
## A discord bot for pentesters

**HackersBot** is a versatile and powerful Discord bot designed specifically for penetration testers, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts. This bot provides a wide range of reverse shell commands in various programming languages and tools, making it an indispensable assistant for conducting security assessments and penetration testing activities.

Finding an easy, quick reverse shell without leaving your discord server seems great, in my opinion. That's why by typing a single command in **hackersbot** you can have a _copy-paste_ ready reverse shell with your IP and port of choice included!

Awesome right? ðŸ¥³
