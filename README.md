## A simple discord bot for pentesters

Hello everyone. I created the **hackersbot** discord bot because why not. I like experimenting with stuff and because I use **Discord** a **LOT** I 
wanted to make something that I could find really useful. The idea started when I was typing commands that I use in terminal, inside Discord chat. If 
you use it just like me you are probably going to find **hackersbot** really useful. 

Finding an easy, quick reverse shell without leaving your discord server seems great, in my opinion. That's why by typing a single command in 
**hackersbot** you can have a _copy-paste_ ready reverse shell with your IP included!

Awesome right? ðŸ¥³
